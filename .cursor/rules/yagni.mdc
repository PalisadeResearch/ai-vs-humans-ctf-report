description: Enforces the YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle
globs: *
---
- Keep code simple and focused on current requirements
- Avoid implementing features or optimizations for hypothetical future needs
- Only add complexity when there is a concrete, immediate requirement

Code should:
- Solve the current problem directly
- Not include speculative abstractions
- Not add flexibility for imagined future use cases
